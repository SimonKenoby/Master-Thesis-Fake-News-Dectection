  title       = {A C-LSTM Neural Network for Text Classification},
  abstract    = {Neural network models have been demonstrated to be capable of achieving remarkable performance in sentence and document modeling. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are two mainstream architectures for such modeling tasks, which adopt totally different ways of understanding natural languages. In this work, we combine the strengths of both architectures and propose a novel and unified model called C-LSTM for sentence representation and text classification. C-LSTM utilizes CNN to extract a sequence of higher-level phrase representations, and are fed into a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to obtain the sentence representation. C-LSTM is able to capture both local features of phrases as well as global and temporal sentence semantics. We evaluate the proposed architecture on sentiment classification and question classification tasks. The experimental results show that the C-LSTM outperforms both CNN and LSTM and can achieve excellent performance on these tasks.},

  title        = {SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique},
  abstract     = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

  abstract    = {In this work, we apply word embeddings and neural networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to text classification problems, where the classification criteria are decided by the context of the application. We examine two applications in particular. The first is that of Actionability, where we build models to classify social media messages from customers of service providers as Actionable or Non-Actionable. We build models for over 30 different languages for actionability, and most of the models achieve accuracy around 85%, with some reaching over 90% accuracy. We also show that using LSTM neural networks with word embeddings vastly outperform traditional techniques. Second, we explore classification of messages with respect to political leaning, where social media messages are classified as Democratic or Republican. The model is able to classify messages with a high accuracy of 87.57%. As part of our experiments, we vary different hyperparameters of the neural networks, and report the effect of such variation on the accuracy. These actionability models have been deployed to production and help company agents provide customer support by prioritizing which messages to respond to. The model for political leaning has been opened and made available for wider use.},

In this paper, we present liar: a new, publicly available dataset for fake news detection. We collected a decade-long, 12.8K manually labeled short statements in various contexts from PolitiFact.com, which provides detailed analysis report and links to source documents for each case. This dataset can be used for fact-checking research as well. Notably, this new dataset is an order of magnitude larger than previously largest public fake news datasets of similar type. Empirically, we investigate automatic fake news detection based on surface-level linguistic patterns. We have designed a novel, hybrid convolutional neural network to integrate meta-data with text. We show that this hybrid approach can improve a text-only deep learning model.},

  title       = {Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN): Building A Longer and Deeper RNN},
  abstract    = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely used for processing sequential data. However, RNNs are commonly difficult to train due to the well-known gradient vanishing and exploding problems and hard to learn long-term patterns. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) were developed to address these problems, but the use of hyperbolic tangent and the sigmoid action functions results in gradient decay over layers. Consequently, construction of an efficiently trainable deep network is challenging. In addition, all the neurons in an RNN layer are entangled together and their behaviour is hard to interpret. To address these problems, a new type of RNN, referred to as independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), is proposed in this paper, where neurons in the same layer are independent of each other and they are connected across layers. We have shown that an IndRNN can be easily regulated to prevent the gradient exploding and vanishing problems while allowing the network to learn long-term dependencies. Moreover, an IndRNN can work with non-saturated activation functions such as relu (rectified linear unit) and be still trained robustly. Multiple IndRNNs can be stacked to construct a network that is deeper than the existing RNNs. Experimental results have shown that the proposed IndRNN is able to process very long sequences (over 5000 time steps), can be used to construct very deep networks (21 layers used in the experiment) and still be trained robustly. Better performances have been achieved on various tasks by using IndRNNs compared with the traditional RNN and LSTM.

Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces
significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center
of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure
at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several
different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes
seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how
t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the
data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of
t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization
techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-

  abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efﬁcient and effective inductive learning algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive performance in classiﬁcation is surprising, because the conditional independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classiﬁcation? In this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classiﬁcation performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classiﬁcation) or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role. Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We propose and prove a sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the optimality of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufﬁcient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore when naive Bayes works well.},

  abstract      = {The word2vec model and application by Mikolov et al. have attracted a great amount of attention in recent two years. The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models. This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter update equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization techniques, including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Intuitive interpretations of the gradient equations are also provided alongside mathematical derivations. In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and backpropagation is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to facilitate the intuitive understanding of the model.},

  title         = {TI-CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks for Fake News Detection},
  __markedentry = {[simon:]},
  abstract      = {With the development of social networks, fake news for various commercial and political purposes has been appearing in large numbers and gotten widespread in the online world. With deceptive words, people can get infected by the fake news very easily and will share them without any fact-checking. For instance, during the 2016 US president election, various kinds of fake news about the candidates widely spread through both official news media and the online social networks. These fake news is usually released to either smear the opponents or support the candidate on their side. The erroneous information in the fake news is usually written to motivate the voters' irrational emotion and enthusiasm. Such kinds of fake news sometimes can bring about devastating effects, and an important goal in improving the credibility of online social networks is to identify the fake news timely. In this paper, we propose to study the fake news detection problem. Automatic fake news identification is extremely hard, since pure model based fact-checking for news is still an open problem, and few existing models can be applied to solve the problem. With a thorough investigation of a fake news data, lots of useful explicit features are identified from both the text words and images used in the fake news. Besides the explicit features, there also exist some hidden patterns in the words and images used in fake news, which can be captured with a set of latent features extracted via the multiple convolutional layers in our model. A model named as TI-CNN (Text and Image information based Convolutinal Neural Network) is proposed in this paper. By projecting the explicit and latent features into a unified feature space, TI-CNN is trained with both the text and image information simultaneously. Extensive experiments carried on the real-world fake news datasets have demonstrate the effectiveness of TI-CNN.},

  title        = {Some Like it Hoax: Automated Fake News Detection in Social Networks},
  abstract     = {In recent years, the reliability of information on the Internet has emerged as a crucial issue of modern society. Social network sites (SNSs) have revolutionized the way in which information is spread by allowing users to freely share content. As a consequence, SNSs are also increasingly used as vectors for the diffusion of misinformation and hoaxes. The amount of disseminated information and the rapidity of its diffusion make it practically impossible to assess reliability in a timely manner, highlighting the need for automatic hoax detection systems. As a contribution towards this objective, we show that Facebook posts can be classified with high accuracy as hoaxes or non-hoaxes on the basis of the users who "liked" them. We present two classification techniques, one based on logistic regression, the other on a novel adaptation of boolean crowdsourcing algorithms. On a dataset consisting of 15,500 Facebook posts and 909,236 users, we obtain classification accuracies exceeding 99% even when the training set contains less than 1% of the posts. We further show that our techniques are robust: they work even when we restrict our attention to the users who like both hoax and non-hoax posts. These results suggest that mapping the diffusion pattern of information can be a useful component of automatic hoax detection systems.},
