I would start by saying thanks to my family, who have always been supportive and who have always believed in me. \\
I would also thanks Professor Itoo for his help and the opportunity he gave me to works on this very interesting subject. \\
In addition I would also thank all the professors of the faculty of applied science for what they taught me during these five years at the University of Li\`ege.
